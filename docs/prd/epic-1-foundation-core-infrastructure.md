# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish foundational project infrastructure including containerization, basic OpenSIPS configuration, Pipecat setup, and health monitoring while delivering an initial voice pipeline demonstration that validates the core technical stack.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Containerization
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a fully containerized development environment with proper dependency management,  
**so that** the team can develop consistently across different machines and deploy reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Docker Compose configuration for development environment with all required services
2. Dockerfile for Python Pipecat application with all AI/ML dependencies
3. Environment variable configuration for different deployment scenarios
4. README with setup instructions and development workflow
5. Git repository structure following monorepo conventions
6. CI/CD pipeline setup for automated testing and building

### Story 1.2: Basic OpenSIPS Configuration
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** OpenSIPS configured for basic SIP call handling and RTP media relay,  
**so that** incoming calls can be routed to the AI Voice Connector.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. OpenSIPS configuration file for SIP proxy functionality
2. Basic call routing to AI Voice Connector endpoint
3. RTP media relay configuration for audio streams
4. SIP registration handling for testing scenarios
5. Basic logging and monitoring of SIP transactions
6. Health check endpoint for OpenSIPS service status

### Story 1.3: Pipecat Core Setup and Health Check
**As a** developer,  
**I want** basic Pipecat pipeline setup with health monitoring,  
**so that** we have a foundation for adding AI components and can verify system status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Pipecat application initialization with basic configuration
2. Health check HTTP endpoint returning system status
3. Basic logging framework with structured logging
4. Configuration management for different pipeline components
5. Basic audio input/output pipeline (passthrough) for testing
6. Integration with Docker container orchestration

### Story 1.4: gRPC Service Architecture Setup
**As a** system architect,  
**I want** gRPC service definitions and communication patterns established,  
**so that** all inter-service communication follows consistent protocols and interfaces.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. gRPC service definitions (.proto files) for core services
2. gRPC server implementation for AI Voice Connector service
3. gRPC client libraries for inter-service communication
4. Authentication and security configuration for gRPC endpoints
5. Error handling and retry policies for gRPC calls
6. Performance monitoring and metrics collection for gRPC services
