# Epic 3: Real-time Audio Transport & SIP Integration

**Epic Goal:** Complete the real-time audio transport layer with full SIP/RTP integration, PCMU/PCM audio conversion, and seamless connection between OpenSIPS and the AI pipeline, enabling end-to-end voice calls with sub-700ms latency.

### Story 3.1: RTP Audio Stream Handling
**As a** telephony system,  
**I want** proper RTP audio stream ingestion and transmission,  
**so that** audio can flow bidirectionally between callers and the AI pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. RTP audio stream reception from OpenSIPS with 20ms packet handling (~160 bytes each)
2. RTP audio stream transmission back to OpenSIPS for caller playback
3. Real-time audio buffering and jitter handling
4. Packet loss detection and basic recovery mechanisms
5. RTP session management and cleanup
6. Monitoring of audio stream quality metrics

### Story 3.2: PCMU/PCM Audio Conversion
**As a** audio processing system,  
**I want** seamless conversion between PCMU/8000 and PCM formats,  
**so that** telephony audio can be processed by AI components and returned to callers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PCMU/8000 ulaw to PCM 16-bit, 16kHz conversion with <10ms latency
2. PCM 22050Hz mono to PCMU/8000 conversion with <10ms latency
3. Audio resampling and format conversion accuracy
4. Real-time processing without audio artifacts
5. Memory-efficient audio buffer management
6. Quality validation and audio integrity testing

### Story 3.3: AI Voice Connector Integration Layer
**As a** system architect,  
**I want** a comprehensive AI Voice Connector that bridges SIP/RTP and Pipecat,  
**so that** all audio transport, conversion, and AI orchestration work seamlessly together.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. AI Voice Connector service managing SIP session lifecycle via gRPC APIs
2. Integration with OpenSIPS for call setup and teardown
3. Audio stream routing between RTP and Pipecat pipeline
4. Session state management across call duration
5. Error handling for network and audio processing failures
6. Configuration management for different deployment scenarios

### Story 3.4: Barge-in and Interruption Handling
**As a** conversation participant,  
**I want** the ability to interrupt the AI assistant mid-response,  
**so that** natural conversational flow is maintained.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MinWordsInterruptionStrategy implementation for detecting valid interruptions
2. Real-time audio monitoring during TTS playback
3. Immediate TTS cancellation when interruption detected
4. Smooth audio transition from TTS to user speech
5. Context preservation during interruption scenarios
6. Configurable interruption sensitivity and validation

### Story 3.5: End-to-End Call Flow Integration
**As a** banking customer,  
**I want** to make a complete voice call that connects through OpenSIPS to the AI assistant,  
**so that** I can have a natural conversation about my banking needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Complete SIP call setup from external caller through OpenSIPS to AI Voice Connector
2. Bidirectional audio flow with proper call control
3. End-to-end latency measurement and validation (<700ms total)
4. Call termination and cleanup handling
5. Comprehensive integration testing with real SIP clients
6. Performance monitoring and latency reporting

### Story 3.6: Monitoring and Session Management
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of call sessions and audio quality,  
**so that** I can ensure system performance and troubleshoot issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Session ID assignment and tracking across all components
2. Real-time metrics collection for latency, audio quality, and system performance
3. Structured logging of call flow events and timing
4. Error classification and alerting (VAD timeout, ASR empty, LLM failure, TTS error)
5. Dashboard for monitoring active sessions and system health
6. Historical reporting and analytics capabilities
