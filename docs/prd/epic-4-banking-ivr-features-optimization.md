# Epic 4: Banking IVR Features & Optimization

**Epic Goal:** Implement the Card Delivery Status Inquiry MVP scenario with banking-specific conversation flows, optimize the entire system to meet strict latency targets, and prepare the solution for production deployment in a banking environment.

### Story 4.1: Card Delivery Status Inquiry Flow
**As a** banking customer,  
**I want** to inquire about my card delivery status through natural conversation,  
**so that** I can get real-time updates without navigating complex menu systems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Natural language understanding for card delivery inquiries (variations like "Where is my card?", "Card status", "When will my card arrive?")
2. Customer authentication integration (account number, phone verification, etc.)
3. Backend integration with card delivery tracking systems (mock API for MVP)
4. Conversational responses with delivery status, tracking numbers, and estimated delivery dates
5. Error handling for invalid accounts, missing information, or system unavailability
6. Conversation flow testing with multiple inquiry variations

### Story 4.2: Banking-Specific Context and Safety
**As a** banking compliance officer,  
**I want** appropriate security controls and conversation boundaries,  
**so that** customer data is protected and interactions remain within approved banking scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) filtering and protection in logs
2. Banking-appropriate response templates and conversation boundaries
3. Conversation timeout and session security controls
4. Audit logging for compliance requirements
5. Escalation paths for complex queries outside MVP scope
6. Security testing for data leakage and unauthorized access

### Story 4.3: Performance Optimization and Latency Tuning
**As a** system performance engineer,  
**I want** the entire pipeline optimized to consistently meet latency targets,  
**so that** customers experience responsive, real-time conversations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. End-to-end latency consistently under 700ms (p95) through optimization
2. Component-level latency optimization (VAD ≤20ms, ASR ≤250ms, LLM ≤300ms, TTS ≤200ms)
3. Memory and CPU optimization for concurrent session handling
4. GPU resource optimization for ML inference
5. Network optimization and buffering strategies
6. Load testing with multiple concurrent calls

### Story 4.4: Conversation Context and Memory Management
**As a** banking customer,  
**I want** the AI to remember context throughout our conversation,  
**so that** I don't have to repeat information and can have natural follow-up questions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Session-based conversation memory storing customer context
2. Context-aware responses that reference previous conversation elements
3. Memory management for long conversations without performance degradation
4. Context cleanup and session termination handling
5. Multi-turn conversation testing for card delivery scenarios
6. Memory overflow protection and graceful degradation

### Story 4.5: Production Deployment Configuration
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** production-ready deployment configurations and operational procedures,  
**so that** the system can be deployed reliably in a banking environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Production Docker configurations with security hardening
2. Environment-specific configuration management (dev, staging, production)
3. Backup and disaster recovery procedures
4. Production monitoring and alerting configuration
5. Deployment automation and rollback procedures
6. Documentation for operations team and troubleshooting guides

### Story 4.6: MVP Testing and Validation
**As a** product manager,  
**I want** comprehensive testing of the Card Delivery Status Inquiry MVP,  
**so that** we can validate the solution meets business requirements and customer needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. End-to-end testing with real banking customer scenarios
2. User acceptance testing with sample conversations
3. Performance validation under realistic load conditions
4. Integration testing with banking systems and data sources
5. Security and compliance testing for banking regulations
6. MVP demonstration and stakeholder sign-off
