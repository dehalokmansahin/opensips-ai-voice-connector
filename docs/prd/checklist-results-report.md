### Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | Well-scoped card delivery scenario |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PARTIAL | Limited to voice UI, needs conversation flow detail |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | Complete with clear identifiers |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | Comprehensive latency targets |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | Well-sequenced, appropriate sizing |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | Clear architecture direction |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Banking integration details needed |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Well-structured and clear |

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH:**
- Banking compliance requirements need more detail (PCI DSS, SOX, etc.)
- Customer authentication flow specifics missing
- Error handling for banking system outages undefined

**MEDIUM:**
- Conversation timeout policies for banking security
- Data retention policies for call recordings
- Performance monitoring dashboard specifics

**LOW:**
- User research citations (acceptable for technical MVP)
- Competitive analysis depth (sufficient for initial implementation)

### MVP Scope Assessment

**✅ Scope is Appropriate:**
- Single use case (card delivery) is perfect for validation
- Technical complexity is manageable for MVP
- Clear path from MVP to production scaling

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- Banking integration mock APIs keep scope minimal
- Dual AI provider options provide good flexibility
- Timeline realistic for 4-epic structure

### Technical Readiness

**✅ Well Defined:**
- Clear technical stack and constraints
- Latency targets are specific and measurable
- Architecture guidance supports implementation

**⚠️ Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- GPU resource sizing for concurrent sessions
- Network topology for banking environment deployment
- OpenSIPS configuration optimization

### Recommendations

1. **Add banking compliance section** to Technical Assumptions
2. **Define customer authentication flow** in Story 4.1 acceptance criteria
3. **Specify banking system integration patterns** for production readiness
4. **Document conversation security policies** for banking environment

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD provides comprehensive requirements with clear technical guidance. The identified gaps are enhancement-level items that don't block architectural design work.
