# Phase 3 Planning - OpenSIPS AI Voice Connector

**Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Phase:** 3 - Real-time Audio Transport & SIP Integration

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on implementing real-time telephony integration with OpenSIPS, establishing robust RTP audio transport, and creating comprehensive testing frameworks. This phase transforms the AI Voice Connector from a development prototype into a production-ready telephony system.

  - SDP negotiation with codec selection
  - Production-grade SIP message handling

#### 3.3 RTP Transport Enhancement (5 points)
- **Owner:** Audio Engineer
- **Timeline:** Week 2-3  
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.2
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Production-quality RTP streaming
  - Audio format conversion (PCMU ↔ PCM)
  - Jitter buffer and packet loss handling

#### 3.4 End-to-End Integration Testing (5 points)
- **Owner:** QA Engineer
- **Timeline:** Week 3-4
- **Dependencies:** Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Comprehensive E2E test automation
  - Performance and load testing
  - Real-world telephony scenario validation

#### 3.5 Production Hardening (5 points)
- **Owner:** DevOps Engineer
- **Timeline:** Week 4-5
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.4
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Production deployment configurations
  - Monitoring, logging, and alerting
  - Security hardening and compliance

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **OpenSIPS Event Listener** - Real-time call event processing
2. **SIP Backend** - Complete SIP protocol implementation  
3. **RTP Transport** - High-quality audio streaming
4. **Pipeline Integration** - Seamless AI service integration

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Audio Codec:** PCMU (G.711 μ-law) for telephony compatibility
- **Transport Protocol:** UDP for real-time performance
- **Event Processing:** Asynchronous event-driven architecture
- **Error Handling:** Circuit breaker pattern with graceful degradation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Handle concurrent SIP calls (minimum 10 simultaneous)
- ✅ Process real-time audio with < 150ms latency
- ✅ Maintain call quality with < 1% packet loss
- ✅ Support standard telephony features (hold, transfer, etc.)

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- ✅ 99.9% uptime under normal load
- ✅ Graceful handling of network interruptions
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- ✅ Security compliance for telephony systems

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Audio Quality Issues** - Mitigation: Extensive testing with real telephony equipment
2. **SIP Compatibility** - Mitigation: Standards compliance testing with multiple providers
3. **Performance Under Load** - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization cycles

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Integration Complexity** - Mitigation: Incremental integration approach
2. **Deployment Challenges** - Mitigation: Staged production rollout

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- OpenSIPS server configuration and integration
- Network infrastructure for RTP traffic
- Telephony provider SIP trunks for testing

### Internal Dependencies  
- Completed Phase 2.5 architectural cleanup
- gRPC service stability (ASR, LLM, TTS)
- Docker and orchestration infrastructure

## Deliverables

### Week 4 Checkpoint
- All stories implemented and unit tested
- E2E testing framework operational
- Performance benchmarks established

### Week 6 Final Delivery
- Production-ready system deployment
- Complete documentation and runbooks
- Monitoring and alerting systems active
- Security audit completed

## Next Steps

1. **Story Kickoff** - Initialize development teams for parallel work
2. **Infrastructure Setup** - Prepare development and testing environments  
3. **External Coordination** - Coordinate with OpenSIPS and telephony teams
4. **Testing Strategy** - Define comprehensive testing approach
5. **Production Planning** - Prepare deployment and rollback procedures
