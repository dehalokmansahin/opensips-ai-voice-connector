# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable automated testing of IVR systems through phone call interactions
- Replace manual IVR testing with automated voice-based test execution
- Provide a web interface for managing test scenarios and monitoring call progress
- Support DTMF tone generation for IVR navigation testing
- Enable step-by-step test case execution with real-time validation
- Utilize existing Pipecat ASR/TTS infrastructure for voice processing
- Support multiple phone lines with organized scenario management

### Background Context

This project transforms an existing OpenSIPS AI Voice Connector into a specialized IVR Flow Automation System. The system addresses the challenge of manual IVR testing by automating the entire testing workflow through programmatic phone calls. Instead of requiring human testers to manually call and navigate IVR systems, this solution uses Twilio for outbound calling, text-to-speech for sending prompts to IVRs, automatic speech recognition for capturing IVR responses, and intent recognition for validating expected behaviors. The system maintains the existing Pipecat ASR/TTS pipeline while removing the OpenSIPS dependency in favor of Twilio's more suitable telephony services for automated testing scenarios.
