# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Develop a real-time, low-latency voice assistant that enhances banking IVR user experience
- Enable natural, bidirectional spoken interactions over standard SIP/RTP infrastructure
- Integrate seamlessly with existing banking call center systems
- Provide sub-200ms response latency for real-time conversational flow
- Support standard telephony audio formats (PCMU/8000) without requiring specialized hardware
- Deliver reliable barge-in capabilities for natural conversation interruption handling
- Maintain high availability and fault tolerance for production banking environments

### Background Context

Banking IVR systems traditionally rely on menu-driven interactions that frustrate users with lengthy navigation paths and limited flexibility. This project addresses the need for conversational AI that can understand natural speech and respond intelligently while maintaining the reliability and security standards required for financial services.

The solution leverages Pipecat as the core orchestrator with an AI Voice Connector layer that manages the complex coordination between Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Models (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) components. By utilizing standard SIP/RTP protocols through OpenSIPS, the system integrates with existing telephony infrastructure without requiring specialized hardware or proprietary protocols.
