# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis with brownfield architecture document created at: `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`

### Current Project State
The OpenSIPS AI Voice Connector is a real-time AI voice processing pipeline that provides natural conversation experiences through a VAD → STT → LLM → TTS pipeline with barge-in interruption support. Currently deployed as a monolithic Docker Compose application using OpenSIPS for SIP telephony, with containerized AI services (Vosk for STT, Llama 3.2 for LLM, Piper for TTS). The system follows a simplified architecture pattern inspired by Twilio/Telnyx implementations.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
- [x] Technology Stack Upgrade
- [x] Integration with New Systems
- [x] Major Feature Modification

### Enhancement Description
Architecture modernization to support Google Cloud Platform deployment with multi-provider telephony (adding Twilio alongside OpenSIPS), multi-provider LLM support (adding Ollama alongside Llama), and enhanced STT capabilities (adding Faster-whisper alongside Vosk).

### Impact Assessment
- [x] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable cloud-native deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GKE/Cloud Run)
- Support Twilio telephony for broader reach and reliability
- Add Ollama integration for flexible local LLM deployment
- Integrate Faster-whisper for improved STT accuracy and performance
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing OpenSIPS deployment
- Create provider-agnostic architecture for future extensibility

### Background Context
The current system is tightly coupled to OpenSIPS for telephony and specific AI service implementations. To scale and reach broader markets, the system needs cloud deployment capabilities and support for industry-standard telephony providers like Twilio. Additionally, supporting multiple AI providers (Ollama for LLMs, Faster-whisper for STT) will provide flexibility in deployment scenarios and performance optimization. This modernization will transform the system from a monolithic local deployment to a cloud-native, multi-provider architecture while maintaining all existing functionality.
