Start with Epic 1 to establish OpenSIPS outbound calling capabilities and basic test framework foundation.

### Architect Prompt
Review the simplified IVR Flow Automation System requirements and create a technical architecture plan for transforming the existing voice assistant into an automated IVR testing platform using OpenSIPS for outbound calls.

### Development Focus
Keep implementation simple and focused on core IVR testing capabilities with minimal complexity.
