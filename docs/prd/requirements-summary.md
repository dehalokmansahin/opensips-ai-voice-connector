# Requirements Summary

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The service import system will resolve common_pb2 module dependencies across all gRPC services without breaking existing proto file functionality.

**FR2**: Each microservice (ASR, LLM, TTS) will include a comprehensive unit testing framework using pytest with asyncio support for gRPC testing.

**FR3**: The LLM service Docker build process will be optimized to reduce build times while maintaining full PyTorch functionality.

**FR4**: All Docker services will include grpc-health-probe installation for proper health check functionality.

**FR5**: A development mode configuration (docker-compose.dev.yml) will enable hot-reload capabilities for source code changes.

**FR6**: Test fixtures and factories will be created following the established testing strategy for shared test data generation.

## Non Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Service startup times must not exceed current baselines (ASR/TTS: 40s, LLM: 60s, Core: 60s) after optimizations.

**NFR2**: Unit test execution must complete within 30 seconds per service for rapid development feedback.

**NFR3**: Docker build optimization must maintain current memory usage patterns (< 4GB total system usage).

**NFR4**: Hot-reload functionality must reflect code changes within 30 seconds of file modification.

**NFR5**: All health checks must respond within 10 seconds to maintain existing Docker Compose orchestration timing.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **Existing API Compatibility**: All gRPC service APIs must maintain current protobuf definitions and not break existing service communication patterns.

**CR2**: **Database Schema Compatibility**: Configuration file formats (app.ini) and model file structures must remain unchanged to preserve existing deployments.

**CR3**: **UI/UX Consistency**: HTTP management interface (port 8080) and logging output formats must maintain current behavior for operational consistency.

**CR4**: **Integration Compatibility**: Docker Compose service definitions must remain compatible with existing volume mounts and environment variable configurations.

## Technical Constraints

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.10+ with mandatory type hints
**Frameworks**: gRPC, asyncio, pipecat pipeline framework
**Database**: File-based configuration (app.ini), model files (Vosk, LLaMA, Piper)
**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, custom network bridge (172.20.0.0/16)
**External Dependencies**: Vosk ASR models, LLaMA GGUF models, Piper TTS models

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing file-based configuration with enhanced validation and error handling
**API Integration Strategy**: Preserve current gRPC service definitions while fixing import resolution and adding health endpoints  
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Maintain HTTP management interface while adding development debugging capabilities
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement pytest framework parallel to existing validation scripts without disrupting current testing approach

### Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: 
- Proto file changes could break service communication
- LLM build optimization might affect model loading
- Test framework integration could interfere with existing validation

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement changes incrementally with rollback points
- Maintain separate development and production configurations
- Use Docker multi-stage builds to control image sizes
- Implement comprehensive integration testing before deployment
