# Infrastructure and Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Docker Compose 2.23.0 for development, Kubernetes 1.28.x for production
- **Location:** `infrastructure/docker/` and `infrastructure/kubernetes/`
- **Approach:** GitOps with declarative configurations for reproducible deployments

### Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Environments

- **Development:** Local Docker Compose with hot-reload and debugging
- **Staging:** Kubernetes cluster with production-like configuration for testing
- **Production:** High-availability Kubernetes with auto-scaling and monitoring

### Environment Promotion Flow

```text
Development (Docker Compose) → Staging (K8s) → Production (K8s)
- Automated testing at each stage
- Manual approval required for production
- Automated rollback on health check failures
```

### Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Kubernetes rolling update rollback with previous image versions
- **Trigger Conditions:** Health check failures, latency threshold breaches, error rate spikes
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 5 minutes for automatic rollback
