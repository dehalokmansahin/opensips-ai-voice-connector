# Testing Strategy

### Integration with Existing Tests
**Existing Test Framework:** Extend pytest-based testing framework, maintain existing test organization in services/*/tests/, preserve existing test coverage requirements

**Test Organization:** Follow established testing patterns for new services, integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline, maintain existing test data management approaches

**Coverage Requirements:** Maintain existing coverage thresholds for new services, extend existing test reporting, integrate with existing test automation

### New Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests for New Components
- **Framework:** pytest (existing framework)
- **Location:** services/*/tests/ (existing pattern)
- **Coverage Target:** 85% minimum (existing standard)
- **Integration with Existing:** Extend existing test configuration, use existing test utilities

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** End-to-end IVR test execution workflows, service communication validation, OpenSIPS integration testing
- **Existing System Verification:** Ensure ASR/TTS services continue operating correctly, validate existing functionality preservation
- **New Feature Testing:** Test scenario execution, intent recognition accuracy, DTMF generation functionality

#### Regression Testing
- **Existing Feature Verification:** Automated verification that voice assistant functionality remains intact
- **Automated Regression Suite:** Extend existing automated tests to cover transformation scenarios
- **Manual Testing Requirements:** IVR system integration testing, real phone call validation
