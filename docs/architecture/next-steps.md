# Next Steps

This architecture document provides the foundation for implementing the Pipecat IVR Voice Assistant. The next phase involves:

1. **Development Team Setup:**
   - Use this document as the definitive technical reference
   - Begin with Epic 1 implementation (Foundation & Core Infrastructure)
   - Set up development environment using provided Docker Compose configuration

2. **Infrastructure Setup:**
   - Deploy development environment using `infrastructure/docker/`
   - Configure OpenSIPS with provided configuration templates
   - Set up monitoring and observability stack

3. **Service Implementation:**
   - Start with Session Manager and Context Store services
   - Implement AI Voice Connector as the central orchestrator
   - Add AI pipeline services following the component specifications

This architecture ensures scalable, maintainable, and secure implementation of the banking voice assistant system.
