# Next Steps

### Story Manager Handoff
Begin implementation with Epic 1 (OpenSIPS Outbound Call Foundation) from the existing PRD. Focus on establishing basic outbound calling capability and adapting existing ASR/TTS services for IVR interaction. The first story should be OpenSIPS Outbound Configuration (Story 1.1) with clear integration checkpoints to ensure existing system integrity. This architecture document provides the technical foundation for implementing test scenarios while maintaining existing voice assistant functionality throughout the transformation process.

### Developer Handoff
Start implementation with the Intent Recognition service development, leveraging existing gRPC patterns from ASR/TTS services. Follow the established service structure in services/ directory and maintain compatibility with existing protobuf generation workflow. Key technical decisions documented in this architecture are based on actual project analysis of your microservices patterns, Docker containerization approach, and service communication protocols. Implementation should maintain existing system compatibility throughout the transformation process with specific verification steps for ASR/TTS service functionality.

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Intent Recognition service (Turkish BERT integration)
2. Test Controller service (orchestration logic)
3. OpenSIPS outbound call configuration
4. Web interface for test management
5. DTMF generation integration

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Maintain existing ASR/TTS service functionality
- Preserve Docker Compose deployment patterns
- Follow established gRPC communication protocols
- Ensure CPU-only deployment compatibility
- Implement comprehensive testing for new functionality
