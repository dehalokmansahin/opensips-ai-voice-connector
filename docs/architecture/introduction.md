# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Pipecat IVR Voice Assistant, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This system is primarily a backend voice processing system with minimal UI requirements. Any administrative or monitoring interfaces will be addressed in a separate Frontend Architecture Document if needed. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project building on the Pipecat framework foundation. The system will be built from scratch using:

- **Pipecat** as the core audio pipeline orchestrator
- Standard Python AI/ML ecosystem components
- gRPC for service communication
- Docker containerization for deployment

No specific starter template is being used, allowing for optimal architecture design tailored to the banking voice assistant requirements.
