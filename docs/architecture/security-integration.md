# Security Integration

### Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** Service-to-service communication without authentication (existing pattern), container-level isolation, network security through Docker networking

**Authorization:** No internal service authorization (existing pattern), environment-based configuration security

**Data Protection:** Container filesystem isolation, log data protection through volume mounting, model file protection

**Security Tools:** Docker container security, existing logging and monitoring security

### Enhancement Security Requirements
**New Security Measures:** 
- Phone number validation to prevent unauthorized outbound calling
- Test data encryption for sensitive IVR interaction recordings
- Access control implementation for test management web interface

**Integration Points:** 
- Extend existing logging security to new services
- Maintain existing container isolation for new services
- Follow existing configuration security patterns

**Compliance Requirements:** 
- Telephony compliance for outbound calling
- Data retention policies for test recordings
- Access audit trails for test management

### Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** Extend existing security testing patterns to new services

**New Security Test Requirements:** 
- Phone number validation testing
- Test data access control verification
- Web interface security testing

**Penetration Testing:** Include new services in existing security assessment processes
