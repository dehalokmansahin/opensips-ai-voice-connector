# Story 3.2: SIP Backend Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** telephony system architect,
**I want** a comprehensive SIP backend implementation with proxy mode and message validation,
**so that** OpenSIPS can reliably communicate with AI services through standardized SIP protocols with full message validation and compatibility assurance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SIP Proxy Mode implementation - Act as SIP proxy between OpenSIPS and AI services
2. SIP Message Validation Layer - Risk mitigation for SIP compatibility and protocol compliance

4. SDP negotiation with codec selection and media parameter negotiation
5. SIP session lifecycle management with proper error handling and recovery
6. Integration with existing AI Voice Connector for seamless audio pipeline coordination

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 3.1 Foundation**: RTP audio stream handling provides the media transport layer that this SIP backend will coordinate and control through SIP signaling protocols.

### Brainstorming Session Implementation Strategy
**Philosophy**: Risk-First + Full Protocol Compliance approach focusing on robust SIP integration with comprehensive validation.

**Selected Strategies**:
- **SIP Proxy Mode**: Acts as intermediary between OpenSIPS and AI services for protocol translation [Brainstorming Decision]
- **SIP Message Validation Layer**: Comprehensive RFC 3261 compliance checking and error prevention [Risk Mitigation Strategy]
- **Full SIP Protocol Implementation**: Complete INVITE/BYE/ACK/CANCEL support for proper call control [Brainstorming Decision]
- **SDP Negotiation with Codec Selection**: Media parameter negotiation ensuring compatibility [Brainstorming Decision]

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11.7 with asyncio patterns for SIP message handling [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **SIP Proxy**: OpenSIPS 3.4.x for SIP signaling and routing integration [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Communication Protocol**: gRPC 1.60.0 for inter-service communication with AI components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Security Requirements**: TLS 1.3 for transport encryption meeting banking standards [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full RFC 3261 compliance for SIP message handling and validation

### Data Models and Session Integration
- **CallSession Integration**: SIP sessions must correlate with existing session_id and sip_call_id tracking [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- **Session State Management**: SIP session lifecycle aligns with CallSession status enum (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, FAILED, INTERRUPTED) [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- **SIP Call Correlation**: Each SIP session requires proper linking to CallSession.sip_call_id for unified session management [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

### Specific Test Requirements
- SIP message parsing and validation accuracy with RFC 3261 compliance verification
- SIP proxy mode forwarding testing with OpenSIPS integration

- SIP session state management and cleanup verification
- Security testing for authentication and TLS/SIPS support
- Integration testing with RTP audio streams from Story 3.1

### Performance and Compliance Baselines
- **SIP Message Processing**: <50ms per SIP message validation and forwarding
- **Protocol Compliance**: 100% RFC 3261 compliance for all supported SIP methods
- **Session Management**: Proper SIP dialog state tracking without state leaks
