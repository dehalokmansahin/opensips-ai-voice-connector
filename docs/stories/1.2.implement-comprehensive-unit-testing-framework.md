# Story 1.2: Implement Comprehensive Unit Testing Framework

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** each microservice to have a complete unit testing framework with pytest and async support,
**so that** I can develop and refactor with confidence while maintaining code quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each service (ASR, LLM, TTS) has a tests/ directory with pytest configuration
2. Unit tests cover core service functionality with async/await patterns for gRPC testing
3. Test fixtures and factories are available for common test data scenarios
4. Tests can be executed independently and in parallel without conflicts
5. Test coverage reporting is available and meets minimum thresholds per testing strategy

## Integration Verification
**IV1**: **Existing Functionality Verification** - All existing validation scripts (validate_dev_env.py, test_e2e_flow.py) continue to function without modification
**IV2**: **Integration Point Verification** - New test framework does not interfere with existing Docker health checks or service startup procedures
**IV3**: **Performance Impact Verification** - Test execution completes within 30 seconds per service and does not impact production service performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 1.1 Completion Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & QA APPROVED (4/5 ACs passed)
- Service import dependencies resolved
- gRPC services can communicate successfully
- Proto file compilation generates required modules
- Foundation established for comprehensive testing

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11.7 with mandatory type hints, pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Functional Requirement**: FR2 - Each microservice will include a comprehensive unit testing framework using pytest with asyncio support for gRPC testing [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]
- **Performance Requirement**: NFR2 - Unit test execution must complete within 30 seconds per service for rapid development feedback [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]

### File Locations and Structure
- **Test Directory Structure**: services/{service-name}/tests/ for unit tests parallel to src/ [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Configuration**: pytest.ini in each service root directory [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Specific Service Test Paths**:
  - ASR Service: services/asr-service/tests/test_asr_service.py
  - LLM Service: services/llm-service/tests/test_llm_service.py
  - TTS Service: services/tts-service/tests/test_tts_service.py

### Testing Framework Requirements
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support for gRPC testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Patterns**: async/await patterns for gRPC service testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Coverage Requirement**: 90% for services, 80% for utilities [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Mock Strategy**: Use pytest-mock for dependency mocking where needed [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Integration Safety Requirements
- **Compatibility**: Maintain existing validation scripts without modification [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]
- **Performance Baseline**: Test execution within 30 seconds per service [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]
- **Isolation**: Tests run independently without service conflicts [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### gRPC Testing Patterns
- **Testing Approach**: In-process gRPC servers for unit testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Message Testing**: Use grpcio-testing for protobuf message validation
- **Async Testing**: pytest-asyncio for async gRPC client/server testing
- **Service Mocking**: Mock external dependencies while testing service logic

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Test framework interference with existing Docker health checks - implement isolated test execution [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]
- **Performance Risk**: Test execution affecting production service performance - ensure proper test isolation [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]
- **Integration Risk**: New dependencies creating version conflicts - use Docker test environments [Source: docs/brownfield-enhancement-prd.md]

## Testing

### Testing Standards and Requirements
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3 with asyncio support for gRPC testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location**: Each service maintains its own tests/ directory parallel to src/ [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Convention**: test_*.py files parallel to source code [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Coverage Requirement**: 90% for services, 80% for utilities [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Testing Approach for This Story
- **Meta-Testing**: Create tests that validate the testing framework itself
- **Integration Tests**: Verify test framework compatibility with existing validation scripts
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure test execution meets 30-second requirement per service
- **Isolation Tests**: Validate tests run independently without service dependencies

### Specific Test Requirements
- Test framework installation and configuration
- Test discovery and execution patterns
- Coverage reporting functionality
- Parallel test execution capabilities
- Integration compatibility with existing Docker health checks
