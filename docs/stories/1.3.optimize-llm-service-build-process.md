# Story 1.3: Optimize LLM Service Build Process

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the LLM service to build efficiently with optimized Docker layers,
**so that** development iterations are faster and the build process doesn't block development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LLM service Docker build completes in significantly reduced time through multi-stage builds
2. Final image size is optimized while maintaining full PyTorch functionality
3. Model loading performance is preserved or improved after build optimization
4. Build process supports development mode with faster rebuilds for code changes
5. Production functionality remains identical to current implementation

## Integration Verification
**IV1**: **Existing Functionality Verification** - LLM service maintains current gRPC API compatibility and model inference performance

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11.7 with llama-cpp-python and sentence-transformers [Source: services/llm-service/requirements.txt]
- **Functional Requirement**: FR3 - LLM service Docker builds will be optimized through multi-stage builds while maintaining full PyTorch functionality [Source: Epic 1.3]
- **Performance Requirement**: NFR3 - Build time reduction must be significant (target: 50% improvement) while preserving model loading performance [Source: Epic 1.3]

### File Locations and Structure
- **Current Dockerfile**: services/llm-service/Dockerfile
- **New Development Dockerfile**: services/llm-service/Dockerfile.dev (to be created)
- **Requirements Files**: services/llm-service/requirements.txt, services/llm-service/requirements_simple.txt
- **Docker Compose**: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.dev.yml
- **LLM Service Source**: services/llm-service/src/

### Current LLM Service Analysis
- **Current Build**: Python 3.10-slim base with build-essential, gcc, g++, cmake
- **Dependencies**: llama-cpp-python 0.2.0, sentence-transformers 2.2.0, chromadb 0.4.0
- **Model Support**: LLaMA model loading via llama-cpp-python with GGUF format
- **Current Size**: Single-stage build with all dependencies in final image
- **Environment**: Offline mode with TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1, HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1

### Build Optimization Strategy
- **Stage 1 - Base**: System dependencies and build tools (gcc, cmake, build-essential)
- **Stage 2 - Python Dependencies**: Python packages with PyTorch CPU optimizations
- **Stage 3 - Model Preparation**: Model directory setup and cache preparation
- **Stage 4 - Runtime**: Minimal runtime with only necessary components
- **Development Mode**: Volume mounts with hot-reload for faster iterations

### Integration Safety Requirements
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing gRPC service interface [Source: services/llm-service/src/enhanced_llm_server.py]
- **Model Performance**: Preserve LLaMA model loading and inference performance
- **Health Checks**: Ensure optimized service meets existing health check timing (60s start period)
- **Environment Variables**: Maintain compatibility with existing Docker Compose configuration

### Docker Optimization Techniques
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime environments
- **Layer caching**: Optimize COPY commands and dependency installation order
- **PyTorch optimization**: Use CPU-only builds to reduce image size
- **Dependency cleanup**: Remove build tools and cache files from final image
- **Base image selection**: Consider lighter alternatives to python:3.10-slim

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Model loading degradation - implement performance benchmarks and validation
- **Compatibility Risk**: gRPC service changes - maintain existing API contracts
- **Integration Risk**: Docker Compose orchestration disruption - preserve existing service definitions
- **Development Risk**: Hot-reload functionality - ensure development mode doesn't affect production builds
