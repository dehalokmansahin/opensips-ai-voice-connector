# Story 1.4: Enable Development Mode with Hot Reload

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a development configuration that supports hot-reload and debugging capabilities,
**so that** I can make code changes efficiently without rebuilding containers for every modification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.10+ with async/await patterns for all services [Source: requirements.txt]
- **Functional Requirement**: FR4 - Development environment must support hot-reload with <30s change reflection [Source: Epic 1.4]
- **Performance Requirement**: NFR4 - Production performance must not be impacted by development mode features [Source: Epic 1.4]

### File Locations and Structure
- **Current Development Compose**: docker-compose.dev.yml (existing, needs enhancement)
- **Production Compose**: docker-compose.yml (base configuration to extend)
- **Core Application**: core/ (main application source code)
- **Service Sources**: services/*/src/ (individual service source directories)
- **Shared Modules**: services/common/ (shared proto and service base modules)
- **Configuration**: core/config/settings.py (centralized configuration management)

### Current Development Setup Analysis
- **Existing Hot-Reload**: Partial implementation with volume mounts for service source code
- **Debug Logging**: Basic LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG environment variable support
- **Development Mode**: DEVELOPMENT_MODE=1 environment flag implemented
- **Health Checks**: Development-optimized health check intervals (15s vs 30s)
- **Command Overrides**: Python -u flag for unbuffered output in development

### Hot-Reload Implementation Strategy
- **Volume Mount Strategy**: Mount source directories as read-write for immediate file changes
- **Python Module Reloading**: Leverage Python's importlib for automatic module reloading
- **File Watching**: Use Docker's native file system event propagation
- **Process Management**: Configure services to auto-restart on source changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize volume mount overhead with targeted directories

### Development vs Production Mode Differences
- **Logging**: DEBUG vs INFO level with enhanced formatting in development
- **Health Checks**: Faster intervals (15s vs 30s) and reduced retries in development
- **Volume Mounts**: Source code mounted in development, read-only configs in production
- **Environment Variables**: DEVELOPMENT_MODE flag and debug-specific configurations
- **Security**: Relaxed file permissions in development, hardened in production

### Integration Safety Requirements
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing gRPC service interfaces during hot-reload [Source: services/*/src/*_server.py]
- **Service Communication**: Preserve service-to-service communication patterns
- **Health Check Compatibility**: Ensure development health checks don't break orchestration
- **Configuration Management**: Maintain settings.py compatibility with both modes

### Hot-Reload Technical Implementation
- **Source Code Mounting**: 
  - Core: ./core:/app/core:rw
  - Services: ./services/[service]/src:/app/src:rw
  - Common: ./services/common:/app/common:ro
- **Auto-Restart Configuration**: Python module reloading with watchdog integration
- **Development Commands**: Override production commands with development-optimized variants
- **File System Events**: Leverage Docker Desktop file system event propagation on Windows

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Hot-reload overhead - implement targeted volume mounts and file watching
- **Stability Risk**: Service crashes during reload - implement graceful restart mechanisms
- **Compatibility Risk**: Production behavior changes - ensure complete isolation of development features
- **Security Risk**: Development permissions - maintain secure defaults while enabling development workflow

## Testing

### Testing Standards and Requirements
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3 with existing unit test framework from Story 1.2 [Source: docs/stories/1.2.implement-comprehensive-unit-testing-framework.md]
- **Hot-Reload Testing**: Validate code changes reflect within 30-second requirement
- **Integration Testing**: Docker Compose orchestration and service communication validation
- **Mode Switching Testing**: Seamless development/production mode transitions

### Testing Approach for This Story
- **Hot-Reload Performance Tests**: Measure time from code change to service restart
- **Development Mode Tests**: Validate debug logging and enhanced error output
- **Integration Tests**: Verify all services communicate properly in development mode
- **Production Compatibility Tests**: Ensure production mode remains unchanged

### Specific Test Requirements
- Code change reflection time measurement (target: <30 seconds)
- Debug logging output validation with enhanced error reporting
- Service-to-service communication testing in development mode
- Development/production mode switching without service disruption
- Volume mount permission and file watching functionality

### Performance Baselines
- **Hot-Reload Time**: <30 seconds from code change to service restart
- **Development Startup**: Similar to current development mode startup times
- **Service Communication**: Maintain existing latency patterns
- **Health Check Timing**: Development mode health checks (15s intervals)
